A bit "cosmetic" changes though needed for implementing more advanced stuff.
* Renamed args names params for some static methods and marked them with ''@staticmethod''.
* Moved ''0'' into ''default_order_value" variable.
* When an entry point now fails to be loaded, it doesn't disrupt building process.
